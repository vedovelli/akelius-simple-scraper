## Akelius.de simple scraper

Just tell the scraper the quantity of rooms you want and all listings will be open in your default browser.

### Tweaking

The default is "3 Rooms". To change this, edit `scraper.js` and adjust the constant ROOMS.

### Installation and Usage

In your Terminal, before the first usage run `npm install` and then `node scraper.js` everytime you want to check their listings.

### Careful

Avoid overusing this tool. They might block your IP address or change their HTML structure to make it harder to scrape.
